## Hi there 👋

I'm Trisha, a Data Scientist and Software Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that drive insights and impact. Currently pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Boston University, I blend academic research with real-world experience to turn data into action.

I've worked across industries — from healthcare with Roche at Accenture, to tech consulting, and academic research in AI and machine learning. Whether it’s optimizing healthcare operations, predicting weather patterns, or creating full-stack data solutions, I love solving meaningful problems through code, data, and a bit of curiosity.
